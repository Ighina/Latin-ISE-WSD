# Latin-ISE WSD
This repository contains the code and the results of a large scale word sense disambiguation analysis on Latin-ISE corpus.

The repository itself is a pseudo-fork of the original [LatinBERT repository](https://github.com/dbamman/latin-bert) and it closely follows the word sense disambiguation setting of [Bamman et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10053), while using their BERT model pre-trained on latin corpora as described in the original paper.

# Use
All the code related to the word sense disambiguation analysis is contained in the wsd folder of this same repository, while this parent directory contains the pre-trained LatinBERT and other utils functions.
